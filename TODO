= 2.0

  - Rails 2.3 support. This will come initially through a branch on Github.
  - A smaller memory footprint for project builders. Currently they
    load a great deal of Rails into memory with them when launched.
  - A revised user interface for the dashboard.
  - The ability to distribute builders across multiple machines.
  - A project build button on the main project display page.
  - Encouraging a more open community by broadening the core team of those with 
    access to core maintenance tasks.
  - Improving the plugin ecosystem by documenting the plugin API and running tests
    against community plugins.
